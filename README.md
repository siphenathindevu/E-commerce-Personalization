Usage

To use the personalized recommendation system, open the Jupyter Notebook (Untitled_Github_Notebook.ipynb) in your preferred environment. Run the cells sequentially to see the implementation of various algorithms and their results.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle. It includes user interaction data relevant to e-commerce transactions. Ensure to review the data and adjust any preprocessing steps as needed.

Technologies Used

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Graph Neural Networks (DGL or PyTorch Geometric)
Machine Learning algorithms for recommendation

Performance Metrics

The performance of the recommendation system is evaluated using the following metrics:

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Precision
Recall
Results of the evaluation can be found in the notebook, illustrating the effectiveness of the implemented techniques.
