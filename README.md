Usage

To use the personalized recommendation system, open the Jupyter Notebook (Untitled_Github_Notebook.ipynb) in your preferred environment. Run the cells sequentially to see the implementation of various algorithms and their results.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skillsmuggler/amazon-ratings). It includes user interaction data relevant to e-commerce transactions. Ensure to review the data and adjust any preprocessing steps as needed.

Technologies Used

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Graph Neural Networks (DGL or PyTorch Geometric)
Machine Learning algorithms for recommendation

Performance Metrics

The performance of the recommendation system is evaluated using the following metrics:

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Precision
Recall
Results of the evaluation can be found in the notebook, illustrating the effectiveness of the implemented techniques.
